This system represents a fully-fledged blockchain architecture comprising several pivotal components. It includes the ‘Blockchain,’ which acts as the immutable ledger for recording transactions, and the ‘Miner,’ which validates new transactions and records them on the blockchain. The ‘Node’ ensures the consistency of the blockchain across the network, while the ‘Wallet’ holds users' cryptographic keys and manages transactions. The ‘Server’ facilitates communication and data exchange within the network, whereas the ‘LightningNode’ and ‘Channel’ manage off-chain transactions to alleviate network congestion, and the ‘Watchtower’ monitors for malicious activities, ensuring the integrity and security of the entire blockchain network. Each component plays a crucial role in maintaining the smooth operation and functionality of the blockchain system.
